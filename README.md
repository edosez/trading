# Options trading

The following project is a learning attempt in trading field. After reading books and online resources about options trading, I implemented this simple repo to improve both my coding and trading skills.

The repo has currently 3 main goals:

- scrape data from a trading platform (in this case I used an Italian platform, Directa)

- store the collected data into a DB

- queries to evaluate whether the current open positions keep a neutral position (market neutral through delta)

- (eventually) through operations research methods, find a suitable and optimal solution for the best options strategy

has the goal to scrape, clean and store options data from Directa trading platform into a Maria DataBase.
